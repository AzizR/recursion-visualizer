# This is the backend remote code runner for my Recursion Visualizer project. 

The main responsibility here is to inject custom code into whatever the user wrote and
track the recursive call structure and send that back to the frontend to visualize the
end result. 

## Link to the frontend: [Frontend](https://github.com/ProjectsByJackHe/recursion-visualizer-frontend)

As of right now, this backend only supports small ~ medium sized inputs for any given recursive algorithm 
submitted by the user.
